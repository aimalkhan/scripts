# Purpose:
# resize and compress images
# useful for compliance with visa/immigration file size requirements

# Prereqs:
# works on mac iOS Sonoma 14.1.2 (23B92)
# needs imagemagick library that can be installed from homebrew using `brew install imagemagick`

# logic:
# create two directories to store resulting files
# go through all the jpg images in the directory, resize them to Ax836 (keeping aspect ratio the same), and compress them to 40%

# how to use:
# paste the script directly into the directory containing the .jpg images

mkdir resize
mkdir resize_and_compress
for image in *.jpg; do
    sips -Z 836 $image --out "resize/${image%.jpg}_resize.jpg"
    convert "resize/${image%.jpg}_resize.jpg" -quality 40% "resize_and_compress/${image%.jpg}_compress.jpg"
done
